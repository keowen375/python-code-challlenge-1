## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

This challenge involves creating a function that converts it into 24-hour time format. 
The function takes an hour, minute, and period (am/pm) as input and returns the equivalent time in 24-hour format.

**Solution:** 
The`convert_to_24_hour()` function in **Toyproblems1.py** implements this conversion.

To run the solution:
```bash
python Toyproblems1.py


**Challenge 2:**

*Two numbers are positive

*This challenge requires implementing a function that takes three integers as input and returns:
True if exactly two of them are positive numbers and False otherwise.

             **Solution:**
 The exactly_two_positive() function in Toyproblems2.py implements this logic.

To run the solution:

bash

python Toyproblems2.py


Challenge 3: Consonant value

In this challenge,you are to find the highest value of consonant substrings in a given lowercase string. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou", and each consonant is assigned a value from 'a' to 'z'.

Solution: The solve() function in Toyproblems3.py solves this problem by calculating the value of each consonant substring and finding the maximum value.

To run the solution:

bash

python Toyproblems3.py
